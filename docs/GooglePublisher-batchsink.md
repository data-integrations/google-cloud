# Google Cloud Pub/Sub Sink

Description
-----------
This sink writes to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
Cloud Pub/Sub brings the scalability, flexibility, and reliability of enterprise message-oriented
middleware to the cloud. By providing many-to-many, asynchronous messaging that decouples senders and receivers,
it allows for secure and highly available communication between independently written applications.

Credentials
-----------
If the plugin is run on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster, the service account key does not need to be
provided and can be set to 'auto-detect'.
Credentials will be automatically read from the cluster environment.

If the plugin is not run on a Dataproc cluster, the path to a service account key must be provided.
The service account key can be found on the Dashboard in the Cloud Platform Console.
Make sure the account key has permission to access Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
The service account key file needs to be available on every node in your cluster and
must be readable by all users running the job.
