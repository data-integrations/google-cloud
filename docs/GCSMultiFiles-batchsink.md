# Google Cloud Storage Multi Files Sink

Description
-----------
This plugin is normally used in conjunction with the MultiTableDatabase batch source to write records from multiple
databases into multiple directories in various formats. The plugin expects that the directories it needs to write to
will be set as pipeline arguments, where the key is 'multisink.[directory]' and the value is the schema of the data.

Normally, you rely on the MultiTableDatabase source to set those pipeline arguments, but they can also be manually
set or set by an Action plugin in your pipeline. The sink will expect each record to contain a special split field
that will be used to determine which records are written to each directory. For example, suppose the
the split field is 'tablename'. A record whose 'tablename' field is set to 'activity' will be written to the 'activity'
directory.

This plugin writes records to one or more Avro, ORC, Parquet or Delimited format files in a directory on 
Google Cloud Storage.

Cloud Storage allows world-wide storage and retrieval of any amount of data at any time.
You can use Cloud Storage for a range of scenarios including serving website content,
storing data for archival and disaster recovery,
or distributing large data objects to users via direct download.


Credentials
-------------
If the plugin is run on a Google Cloud Dataproc cluster, the service account key does not need to be
provided and can be set to 'auto-detect'.
Credentials will be automatically read from the cluster environment.

If the plugin is not run on a Dataproc cluster, the path to a service account key must be provided.
The service account key can be found on the Dashboard in the Cloud Platform Console.
Make sure the account key has permission to access BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage.
The service account key file needs to be available on every node in your cluster and
must be readable by all users running the job.

Properties
----------
**Reference Name:** This along with the table name will be used to uniquely identify this sink for lineage, 
annotating metadata, etc.

**Project ID:** The Google Cloud Project ID, which uniquely identifies a project.
It can be found on the Dashboard in the Google Cloud Platform Console.

**Path:** The path to write to. For example, gs://<bucket>/path/to/directory

**Path Suffix:** The time format for the output directory that will be appended to the path.
For example, the format 'yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm' will result in a directory of the form '2015-01-01-20-42'.
If not specified, nothing will be appended to the path."

**Format:** Format to write the records in.
The format must be one of 'avro', 'parquet', 'orc' or 'delimited'.

**Delimiter:** Delimiter to use if the format is 'delimited'.
The delimiter will be ignored if the format is anything other than 'delimited'.

**Write Header:** Whether to write a header to each file if the format is 'delimited', 'csv', or 'tsv'.

**Location:** The location where the gcs buckets will get created. This value is ignored if the bucket already exists.

**Encryption Key Name:** Used to encrypt data written to any bucket created by the plugin.
If the bucket already exists, this is ignored.

**Service Account**  - service account key used for authorization

* **File Path**: Path on the local file system of the service account key used for
authorization. Can be set to 'auto-detect' when running on a Dataproc cluster.
When running on other clusters, the file must be present on every node in the cluster.

* **JSON**: Contents of the service account JSON file.

**Codec:** The codec to use when writing data. Must be 'none', 'snappy', 'gzip' or 'deflate', defaults to 'none'. 
The 'avro' supports 'snappy' and 'deflate'. The parquet supports 'snappy' and 'gzip'. 
Other formats does not support compression.

**Allow flexible schemas in Output**: When enabled, this sink will write out records with arbitrary schemas. 
Records may not have a well defined schema depending on the source.
When enabled, the format must be one of 'avro', 'json', 'csv', 'tsv', 'delimited'.

**Split Field:** The name of the field that will be used to determine which directory to write to. 
Defaults to 'tablename'.

**Schema:** Schema of the data to write.
The 'avro' and 'parquet' and 'orc' formats require a schema but other formats do not.

Example
-------

Suppose the input records are:

| id  | name     | email            | tablename |
| --- | -------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| 0   | Samuel   | sjax@example.net | accounts  |
| 1   | Alice    | a@example.net    | accounts  |


| userid | item     | action | tablename |
| ------ | -------- | ------ | --------- |
| 0      | shirt123 | view   | activity  |
| 0      | carxyz   | view   | activity  |
| 0      | shirt123 | buy    | activity  |
| 0      | coffee   | view   | activity  |
| 1      | cola     | buy    | activity  |

The plugin will expect two pipeline arguments to tell it to write the first two records to an 'accounts' directory and
the last records to an 'activity' directory.
