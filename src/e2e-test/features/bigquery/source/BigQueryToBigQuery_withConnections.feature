    Then Validate "BigQuery" plugin properties
    Then Close the Plugin Properties page
    Then Connect plugins: "Wrangler" and "BigQuery2" to establish connection
    Then Save the pipeline
    Then Preview and run the pipeline
    Then Wait till pipeline preview is in running state
    Then Open and capture pipeline preview logs
    Then Verify the preview run status of pipeline in the logs is "succeeded"
    Then Close the pipeline logs
    Then Close the preview
    Then Deploy the pipeline
    Then Run the Pipeline in Runtime
    Then Wait till pipeline is in running state
    Then Open and capture logs
    Then Verify the pipeline status is "Succeeded"
    Then Validate records transferred to target table is equal to number of records from source table
    Given Open Wrangler connections page
    Then Expand connections of type: "BigQuery"
    Then Open action menu for connection: "bqConnectionName" of type: "BigQuery"
    Then Select action: "Delete" for connection: "bqConnectionName" of type: "BigQuery"
    Then Click plugin property: "Delete" button
    Then Verify connection: "bqConnectionName" of type: "BigQuery" is deleted successfully
