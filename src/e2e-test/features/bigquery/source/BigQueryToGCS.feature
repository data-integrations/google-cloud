    Then Verify data is transferred to target GCS bucket

  @BQ_SOURCE_TEST @BQ_SOURCE_VIEW_TEST @GCS_SINK_TEST
  Scenario:Validate successful records transfer from BigQuery to GCS by enable querying views
    Given Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    When Source is BigQuery
    When Sink is GCS
    Then Open BigQuery source properties
    Then Enter BigQuery property reference name
    Then Enter BigQuery property projectId "projectId"
    Then Enter BigQuery property datasetProjectId "projectId"
    Then Override Service account details if set in environment variables
    Then Enter BigQuery property dataset "dataset"
    Then Enter BigQuery source property table name as view
    Then Toggle BigQuery source property enable querying views to true
